        <div id="section2" class="hidden">
          <h2 class="card-title">Were the Penal Laws Fair or Unfair?</h2>
          <p class="card-text">
            The <span class="highlight">Penal Laws</span> were a series of laws passed by the British government that took away many rights from Catholics and some Protestant groups in Ireland. These laws were designed to <span class="highlight">weaken the power of Catholics</span> and ensure that Protestants remained in control.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            One example of a Penal Law was that <span class="highlight">Catholics were not allowed to own land</span>. This meant that Irish Catholic families could not buy or inherit land, making it very hard for them to farm and earn a living. This law was very <span class="highlight">unfair</span> because it forced many families into poverty, while Protestants could own and pass down land freely.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            Another example was that <span class="highlight">Catholics could not vote or become members of Parliament</span>. This meant that they had no way to change the laws that were hurting them. This was clearly <span class="highlight">unfair</span> because it gave power only to Protestants, while the majority of the Irish population had no say in their own country’s government.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            A third unfair law was that <span class="highlight">Catholic children were not allowed to go to school</span> or get an education. This was done to keep Catholics from gaining knowledge and power. Education is important for a better future, and by taking it away, the Penal Laws <span class="highlight">tried to keep Catholics weak and dependent on Protestants</span>.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            Overall, the Penal Laws were extremely <span class="highlight">unfair</span> and were used to <span class="highlight">control and oppress</span> the Catholic majority in Ireland. These laws created <span class="highlight">poverty, inequality, and suffering</span> for many Irish families for generations.

                    <p class="card-text">
                      The <span class="highlight">Battle of the Boyne</span> took place on <span class="highlight">July 1, 1690, between King James II</span> (a Catholic) and <span class="highlight">King William of Orange</span> (a Protestant). William won the battle, forcing James to flee to France.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                      After the battle, <span class="highlight">Protestant rule in Ireland became even stronger, and Catholics faced severe punishments</span>. Many of them lost their land, and new <span class="highlight">Penal Laws</span> were introduced to stop Catholics from gaining power. This battle was a turning point because it ensured that <span class="highlight">Ireland would remain under Protestant British control for a long time</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                      The victory of King William is still celebrated today by some Protestants in Northern Ireland on <span class="highlight">July 12th, known as the Twelfth of July or "Orangemen’s Day."</span> However, for many Catholics, the battle represented the beginning of a long period of oppression.

              The 1700s and 1800s were a difficult time in Irish history.

Although the laws were unfair, they eventually led to resistance and the long fight for Irish independence in the 1900s.
